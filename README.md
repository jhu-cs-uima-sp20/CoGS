# CoGS
Design: 

There are small issues with styling, that we are still working on like overflow and inconsitent styling. Which will be worked on further in Sprint 2. 

One issue is the backgroup not changing/ scrolling which will be implemented soon.
The settings page spacing it a little off which will be worked on.
The filter buttons when going to the group page don't do anything at the moment as they were beyond the scope of Sprint 1.

We felt it was more benefical to work on the implementation and have something functional, and focus more on the design the second sprint.
Animations for the bottom navigation and better transitions will be worked on further in Sprint 2. The bottom navigation was having some issues. There are basic fade animations for the sign up/login pages.

The liked tab works but is disabled since it will be implemented later. 

Implementation 

Login Page: The implementation for this page has been complete. If a user already has an account they will be able to login with their credentials (user and password). The design for the page has been complete. Here is the login information for testing purposes: Email: Aly123@gmail.com, Password: helloworld

Sign-Up Page: Implementation and design for this page have been completed. Users can create an account using their email and set-up a password.
Error: 
While on the main activity if you click the back button the app takes users to the login activity. 
 
Settings Page: The functionality for this page has been complete. Users are able to save their names, courses, and profile picture. This data is saved into the database so once the user saves it they can view the changes once they return to the settings page. 
Errors: 
The back does not work yet
Create Group Page: Implementation for this page has been completed. Users can now create a group, and this information is stored in the database.  

Search Page: Implementation not fully complete. Users can search for a group but only by course name and not group name. If users enter a course id, all the groups associated with that course will be displayed to the user. A few testing Course ID: AS.123.123, AS.400.400  
Errors: 
The RecyclerView seems to move up when users type inside of the search bar. 
Users cannot search by group name only id (Moved this to the next sprint)

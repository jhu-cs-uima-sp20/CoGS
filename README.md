# CoGS

There are small issues with styling, that we are still working on like overflow and inconsitent styling. Which will be worked on further in Sprint 2. 

One know issue is the toolbar icons overflowing, currently working on a work around.
Another issue is the backgroup not changing/ scrolling which will be implemented soon.
The settings page spacing it a little off which will be worked on.
The filter buttons when going to the group page don't do anything at the moment as they were beyond the scope of Sprint 1.

We felt it was more benefical to work on the implementation and have something functional, and focus more on the design the second sprint.
Animations for the bottom navigation and better transitions will be worked on further in Sprint 2. The bottom navigation was having some issues. There are basic fade animations for the sign up/login pages.

The liked tab works but is disabled since it will be implemented later.
